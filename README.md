# laughTests
Code used for the publication of "Laugh tests for land models" by Clark et al.

## Folder structure
Data and code for each laugh test are kept in a separate folder.

## To do
- Update results to those obtained with new solver
- Decide if we want to keep the literature folder
- Decide if we can reproduce the figures from the literature papers in the notebook in the experiment introduction (note: we currently do this)
- Go over each notebook and to check whether all questions we ran into during development have been answered
- Update this readme (note: make sure to clarify the legacy of the solutions and make clear that analytical solutions are based on Martyn's IDL code)
- [optional] Include code to run SUMMA for each laugh test
